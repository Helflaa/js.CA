This is a course assignment for JavaScript.

The assignment was made from scratch with SquareEyes API.

JS1 Course Assignment requirment.
Goal :
Using your new skills writing JavaScript, create an interactive online store to display product from an API endpoint. Use one of the three provided API urls to display products in HTML and allow users to create a basket of items.
You may use your existing cross course project code as a starting point, or start a fresh project if this is not available. We recommend using an existing project as styling will not be graded, but is nice to have in the final submission.

User Stories
- As a user :
want to view a list of products on the homepage.
want to filter products by category, gender or genre.
want to view a single product page with more detail.
want to add a product to my basket.
want to remove a product from my basket.
want to view a summary of my cart on the checkout page. want to view an order-confirmation screen after checking out.
Required Pages
The following pages are required to complete this assignment.
- Home Page containing product list `/index.html`
- Product Page showing all details of a specific product `/product/index.html` - Checkout Page showing all items in the basket `/checkout/index.html`
- Confirmation Page showing a thank you message `/checkout/confirmation/index.html`

Process:
  I started off by deciding which of the three APIs would be the best fit, and I ended up choosing the SquareEyes project because it seemed the easiest to style. Since it's a JavaScript project, I could focus more on that. First, I set up the index page and styled it. Then, I dove into JavaScript and built the rest of the page using data from the API. This way, I didn't have to manually add any products into the HTML, making everything more dynamic and flexible.

Reflection:
  As I work with code examples from lessons and online resources, I understand how they function as I use them. But I still need some time to really get the hang of the best approach for what I'm trying to do. For example, I had trouble using async, so I stuck with .then instead.
